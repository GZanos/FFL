# Online-Transaction-Fraud-Detection-with-Fuzzy-Logistic-Regression
An online fraud detection system for credit card transactions using stratified random sampling to handle non-stationary changes and fuzzy logistic regression modelling.

You can test using the transaction fraud data published on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Step by step process:
1) Run SRS to handle non-stationary changes in transaction fraud patterns and extract desired sample size.
2) Tuning and learning using: https://github.com/GZanos/Fuzzy-Logistic-Regression
3) Online implementation code
